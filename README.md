# Couse Tracker

Welcome to Course Tracker!
Course Tracker is an early production tool where users collectively create a list of courses for others to view.

### Future Plans

Create a user sign in and sign up system and attach a user_id for each course post.

## Tools that helped me

This web app was created with **Django** and **SQLite** and deployed with **Heroku**.

### Django

*Django* is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)

### SQLite

By default, **the django configuration uses SQLite**. It is easy to use and great for small projects!

### Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. The platform also has great Documentation per programming languages and it can be completely free!

Heroku Django docs can be found **[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python)**!
